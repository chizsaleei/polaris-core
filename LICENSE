Effective on the Change Date, the Licensed Work will be made available

notices describing licensing of third-party components that are included

Production use of the Licensed Work, except to the extent permitted by
the Additional Use Grant above, is not permitted under this License prior

If you materially breach the terms of this License, your rights under
this License terminate automatically and immediately. If you cease all
breach and cure within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach, your
rights under this License are reinstated prospectively unless and until
you again breach. Your rights under this License are reinstated
retroactively if the Licensor notifies you of the reinstatement. The
Licensor may bring suit to enforce the terms of this License.

Nothing in this License purports to limit any rights you have under
applicable copyright exceptions and limitations.

The Licensor may publish new versions of the Business Source License
